To the editors,

We hereby submit for review our article "Symmetry constrained machine learning". We consent to review by JMLR.

In this paper we explore the idea of imposing precise symmetries on a machine learning model. We propose a conceptually straightforward and general approach to achieve this goal. We use a toy problem to demonstrate how this approach can be easily implemented, and point out the dangers that can arise from not being careful about imposing symmetry on to a machine learning model.

We argue that considering symmetry in the context of machine learning can expose weaknesses in machine learning systems, and can be used to guard against 
these weaknesses. Furthermore, symmetry can help make machine learning models more compact, and robust to over-fitting, with the ability to satisfy symmetry conditions with complete certainty.

The work presented in this article has not been published before in any journal.

We suggest a number of possible reviewers for this article: Ypshua Bengio, Karsten Borgwardt, Koby Crammer, and Moritz Hardt.

Best regards,
